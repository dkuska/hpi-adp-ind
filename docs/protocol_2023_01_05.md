- Budget:
  - Budgetting with pairs can be considered as baseline
  - Budget distribution depending on statistics of original dataset
  - Should be footing on the same foundation as Consolidation

- Statistics:
  - Assume that we know count, #distinct, min, max over the original dataset

- Visualization:
  - Pivot Chart - Sampling Rate and Method

- Consolidation:
  - Do we have to run multiple experiments and consolidate the results?
  - Ideally we find a sampling-strategy that works best in all cases
  - If this is dependent on the Dataset, then consolidation makes sense

- Credibility:
  - Smaller MissingValues is better
  - MissingValues should be dependent on Sample-Size
  - Assumption:
    - Original Dataset is uniformly distributed
    - Makes it easier to approximate, if missing Value shows up in original dataset
    - Alternatively: Zipf-Distribution
  - Calculating Credibility:
    - Credibility of the Config
      - Average of Sampling-Rates
      - The higher the sampling-rate, the higher our confidence in this
    - Credibility of a single IND:
      - At the moment: missing_values/max missing_values

  - Example:
    - A [= B
    - A_s = sample of A
    - B_s = sample of B
    - Missing_values: mv = |B_s\A_s|
    - Also interesting!!!:
      - |A_s\B_s|
      - mv/|A|
      - mv/|B|
      - A_s\B_s
      - B_s\A_s
      - |A\A_s|
      - |B\B_s|
      - Approximated 'Overlap' between A and B
