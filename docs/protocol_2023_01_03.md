- Recap Christmas Break
  - We were all sick, not as much done, as we would have liked to....

- Budgeting
  - Set #tuples in configuration
  - With this dynamically determine sampling rate
  - Budget should get distributed according to unique-ratio of the columns
  - Fair Approach - Every column get #tuples/#columns tuples of budget. Small columns can return leftover budget to others, which get priority on it based on uniqueness ratio
  - Greedy Approach - Those Columns with highest unique ratio get priority. Define minumum number of tuples for each columns, maybe ~ #tuples/(#columns * 3)
  - Round Robin - Budget Quantum gets distributed fairly. Order depends on uniqueness ratio

- Result Consolidation
  - Somehow combines all results apart from baseline
  - Per IND calculate scores
    - Score calculated based on Sum of Credibilities
    - Credibilities 
    - Threshold calculated 
  - Ranks configurations based on the product of their IND scores
  - Use column statistics to consolidate results

- Column Statistics
  - Should these be calculated only on the Baseline or also on the sampled data

- Sampling Methods
  - We need to be able to combine the sampling methods in an elegant fashion
  - e.g. all unique and shortest together

- Next Steps for the remaining 3 Weeks:
  - 'Combined' Sampling methods = all unique + shortest/longest/smallest/largest
  - Maybe rethink string sorting method
  - Result consolidation
  - Budget Idea 
  - Consolidation - State of the Art Confidence Score calculation
