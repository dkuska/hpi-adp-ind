- Plots/Visualization
  - Histogram Missing_Values/Sampled Column Groesse
  - Impact of ML Model in plausibilization
  - For each Sampling Method and Rate - Histogramm of MissingValues of TPs and FPs

- Final Presentation
  - Formalization Problem Setting
  - Keep notation from Naumanns Book

- Questions for Thursday
  - What are we working on, Partial/Approximate IND?
  - Evaluation vs Training Data
    - Split training and evaluation data on feature level or on dataset level
    - 7 datasets used to train, leave one out for evaluation
    - If we evaluate on 4+ Datasets => 4+ Hyperparameter tuning and Model Training
    - This what they've done in the Rossin et. al Paper
